# Welcome to Momen Meetup

We're excited to launch **Momen meetup** — a social platform designed to transform how you experience meetups. Whether you're a speaker, organizer, or regular attendee, Momen gives you the tools to get more value from every event you attend.

## What makes Momen different?

Traditional meetups end when you leave the venue. The conversation stops, the slides disappear into someone's email, and the momentum fades before the week is over. But the real value of a meetup comes from what happens *after* — the connections you make, the resources you discover, and the ideas you carry forward.

Momen is built on a simple belief: **every meetup should have a life beyond the room**.

## A platform built around community

At the heart of Momen is a community-first approach. Speakers can upload their slides immediately after their talk, making resources available to every attendee in seconds. No more hunting through Twitter threads or asking someone to forward that PDF — everything lives in one organized, searchable place.

But we didn't stop at resource sharing. Momen introduces thread-based conversations linked directly to individual talks, so the Q&A doesn't have to end when the mic goes off. Attendees can continue discussions, ask follow-up questions, and build on ideas long after the event wraps up.

## Gamified participation that rewards engagement

We believe that great communities thrive when participation is recognized and celebrated. That's why Momen includes a gamification layer that rewards attendees for showing up, asking questions, sharing resources, and contributing to conversations. Climb the leaderboard, earn badges, and build a meetup profile that reflects your genuine engagement with the community.

For organizers, this creates a powerful feedback loop — the more valuable the content, the more engaged the community becomes, and the stronger every future event gets.

## Our vision for the Belgian tech community

Momen was born out of the Belgian meetup scene, a vibrant ecosystem of developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and curious minds who gather regularly to share knowledge and build connections. We've seen first-hand how much value gets created in those rooms — and how much of it evaporates the moment people go home.

Our mission is to capture that energy and give it a permanent home. We're starting with the Belgian tech community, but the platform is built to grow with any meetup ecosystem anywhere in the world.

Welcome to Momen. We can't wait to see what your community builds together.
